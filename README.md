# Coroutine Exception Propagation Study
Project to showcase all the coroutine exception propagation and handling rules.
The samples are courtesy of the following tutorial:
https://maxkim.eu/things-every-kotlin-developer-should-know-about-coroutines-part-4-exception-handling

Each module contains a particular case study to observe in the logs how the coroutine cluster reacts to different 
exceptions thrown, either in child or sibling coroutines. It also uses the different coroutine Job() types as well as
the best practices.

Run the examples and check the logs
